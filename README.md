# Crossfit::Shoes

My gem is based off of the CrossFit website (store.crossfit.com/womens-shoes) where they sell different types of Reebok brand name shoes. There will be a list of shoes the user can choose from and when selected it will provide more information about the shoe.

## Usage

When program is run user will select a type of shoe (#1-48). If they select an appropriate corresponding number the program will return the price and the description on the shoe. The program will then also ask if they want to get information on another shoe. If the user does not input a known shoe number an error will be produced prompting the user to enter a valid number.
